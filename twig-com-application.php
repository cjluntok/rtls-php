            <p class="py-3">Companies have a professional obligation to ensure the safety of lone workers is solved by having the support they need on-hand at all times.</p>
            <p class="py-3">Working alone can leave workers vulnerable to assault or violence, where the user could trigger the duress sequences manually with either an audible or silent alarm â€“ immediately altering emergency contacts of their need for assistance along with the location.</p>
            <p class="py-3">A worker entering a potentially hazardous or remote site can initialise an Amber Alert to require a periodic interaction, sending a conformation and location update to ensure their well being. A missed check-in will trigger an emergency sequence.</p>
            <p class="py-3">The sophisticated package of hardware sensors utilised by ManDown can detect scenarios such as the worker being incapacitated or having a fall and automatically raising an alarm, followed by initialising tracking to an alarm receiving centre and ongoing tone to assist responders in locating the individual.</p>
