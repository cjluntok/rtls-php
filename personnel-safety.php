                    <h3>MOTION DETECTION</h3>
                    <p>AiRISTA Flow’s staff safety solutions also feature sophisticated motion detection to help send alerts when victims are unable. Based on stagnate periods, tilt, or a combination, authorities can be notified when a worker or staff member may be incapacitated and unable to seek help themselves. Two-way communication technology in the AiRISTA Flow badge tags from AiRISTA Flow helps to confirm the accuracy for detection of possible man-down situations.</p>
