                        <p>New 2018 Compliance Laws take effect! Hospital-based studies have shown that noncompliance with hand hygiene practices is directly linked with healthcare-associated infections and has been a major contributor to outbreaks. Healthcare-associated infections affecting millions every year have outlined hospitals’ dire needs for robust and innovative automated systems to capture personnel compliance or breach of institution’s hand hygiene protocols.</p>
                        <p>The food services industry requires that both their kitchen and serving staff maintain proper hand hygiene. The FDA helps to ensure that food services employees clean their hands in an approved hand washing station immediately before engaging in food preparation. AiRISTA Flow’s hand hygiene solutions help to guarantee the effective meeting of FDA regulations, required by law.</p>
