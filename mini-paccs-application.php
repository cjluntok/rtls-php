            <p class="py-2">The mini-PACCS on-site man-down system is designed for use by people working alone in industrial, health care, aged care, security and high-risk facilities.</p>
            <p class="py-2">Suitable for clinic, office, small warehouse, retail, small manufacturing, community centre, where transmission distances are up to 50 metres. Can be extended with a repeater.</p>
            <p class="py-2">The system has five types of events: distress - press the two emergency buttons simultaneously; man-down/no movement - when the wearer falls down; pull-cord - when transmitter is pulled off the wearer; test - for testing the transmitter; tamper - an unauthorised person opens the transmitter.</p>
            <p class="py-2">Its message centre comprises receivers and transmitters with their relevant interfaces. It stores and distributes pre-recorded messages from pre-programmed phone numbers, (optionally text messages and emails). It sends them out to a range of receiving units such as mobile and landline phones, computers and warning devices such as strobe lights and audible alarms. Messages can be voice, SMS and even GPS coordinates for pinpointing duress locations.</p>
            <p class="py-2">The device allows single or multiple users and calls pre-designated phone numbers with pre-recorded message, with user choice of escalation. It allows voice and data alarms to be sent over the GSM network and is secure - using factory-programmed, randomly selected codes.</p>
            <p class="py-2">It has a range of 50-100 m indoors and 200-300 m outdoors with an option for a repeater unit to extend the signal, with options for much wider coverage areas including citywide.</p>
            <p class="py-2">The system is remotely accessible for reprogramming options and messages, has mains power with battery back-up option and is supplied as plug-and-play for simple installation.</p>
