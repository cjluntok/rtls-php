                <p>Better asset management supports operational efficiency and helps improve customer experiences. Get ready to innovate with first-class technology and RTLS for asset tracking in your enterprise.</p>

                    <p>For many enterprises, managing thousands of costly, mobile assets and equipment is challenging and labor-intensive. A significant portion of asset inventories are lost, stolen, or misplaced, impacting productivity every day. For example, more than one third of nurses spend at least 1 hour per shift searching for equipment. In this same example, average inventory SKUs for upwards of 35,000 assets are only utilized at a rate of 32-38%, with nearly $4,000 of equipment per bed, lost or stolen each year. This phenomena of underutilization topped with unnecessary rental equipment expenses applies in many other industries. Asset Tracking Solutions from AiRISTA Flow can help reduce many of the inefficiencies that lead to resource waste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, RTLS with asset tracking solutions leveraging RFID-over-Wi-Fi can help lower inventory expenses and shorten equipment search times, prevent theft, and automate maintenance with real-time visibility into the location and status of equipment (i.e. sterilized/unsterile, broken/fixed, in use/available), using an existing Wi-Fi network.</p>

Hospital-based studies have shown that noncompliance with hand hygiene practices is directly linked with healthcare-associated infections and has been a major contributor to outbreaks. Healthcare-associated infections affecting millions every year have outlined hospitals’ dire needs for robust and innovative automated systems to capture personnel compliance or breach of institution’s hand hygiene protocols.</p>
                        <p>The food services industry requires that both their kitchen and serving staff maintain proper hand hygiene. The FDA helps to ensure that food services employees clean their hands in an approved hand washing station immediately before engaging in food preparation. AiRISTA Flow’s hand hygiene solutions help to guarantee the effective meeting of FDA regulations, required by law.</p>

                    <p>The storage of food (in any facility-type or industry); hospitals’ pharmaceuticals, tissues, or organs, and any other temperature/humidity sensitive assets can be critical to operations as well as the well-being of people. If compromised, spoilage or temperature and humidity breaches can cost millions of dollars and a single breach can destroy a business or hospital’s reputation, endanger lives, and jeopardize long-term research programs. Even with the risks involved, many organizations still rely on clip-boards to manually document temperature, which is labor-intensive and error-prone.</p>
                    <p>AiRISTA Flow offers a time-series dashboard view for temperature and humidity data in their software platforms. The active RFID tags have battery-powered sensors placed inside refrigerators that help to prevent breaches by texting AiRISTA Flow RTLS badge tags and sending email notifications when temperature or humidity exceeds software-programmed thresholds.</p>
